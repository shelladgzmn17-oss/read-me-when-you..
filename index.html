  "This website is a small piece of my heart, made for you. Every word in here exists because you exist. I hope you feel how much you are loved, appreciated, and valued. You mean more to me than words can ever fully explain, and this is just a reminder of that.",
  "Hi baby, please think about how far you’ve come and how many times you’ve made me proud without even trying. You’ve already overcome so much, and this moment is no different. I believe in you, even on the days you don’t believe in yourself. Take things one step at a time. You don’t need to be perfect, you just need to keep going. I’m so proud of you, always.",
  "Hi baby, breathe for a second. It’s okay to feel this way. Your feelings are valid, and you don’t have to carry them alone, you always have me. Whatever your mind is telling you right now, remember this: you are loved, you matter, and you are enough. Breathe slowly. This feeling will pass, and I’ll still be here, I will love you until the end of my life. on easy days and hard ones, when things are quiet or messy, always remember that my heart will always choose you.",
  "Hi baby ko! please always remember that you are never alone, i’m always with you, remember how it feels when we cuddle? it feels like safe, warm and calm, and that’s how i feel about you all the time. even when i’m not there, my love is always with you, quietly reminding you that you matter so much. BIG BIG HUGGGGG PLS ",
  "I know things can get overwhelming, and it’s okay to feel angry or upset. Pause for a moment. Breathe. Remember how our bahay dates calm us down? that’s how just being together makes everything feel lighter. This feeling will pass. You’re allowed to feel upset, but don’t forget that I’m always here, ready to listen and understand you. KISS PLS!",
  "Hi baby, don’t forget to drink ur meds pls! I wish I could be right there taking care of you. Please rest and be gentle with yourself. You don’t need to be strong right now, just focus on getting better. Get well soon, my love. I miss youuu so muchhh!",
  "Hi my handsome babyy, you are so attractive in ways you don’t even realize. The way you laugh, your corny jokes HAHAHAHA (Your smile can literally change my entire day) and ofc, the way you make me feel comfortable just being myself, everything about you feels special to me. I LOVE BIG TIME!",
  "I choose you. Over and over again. On good days and bad days, in calm moments and hard ones. You are important to me, and what we have is real and worth holding onto. I LOVE YOU SO MUCHHH, MY HUBBYY!!",
  "Hi baby, I know we’re not good today. There are days we argue, days we feel tired, and days when things don’t feel perfect. But one thing will never change, I will always love you. No matter how hard the day is, at the end of it, my heart still chooses you. I will always choose to fix things with you, not walk away. Through good times and bad times, through laughter and tears, you are still the person I want to love forever.",
